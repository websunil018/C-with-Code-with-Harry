    // Store the employee id in a character array which is allocated dynamically.
    // You have to create only one character array dynmically
// EXAMPLE:
    // employee 1:
    // Enter no of character in your eID
    // 45
    // dynamically allocate the character array.
    // take input form user 

    // employee 2:
    // Enter no of character in your eID
    // 4
    // dynamically allocate the character array.
    // take input form user 

    // employee 3:
    // Enter no of character in your eID
    // 9
    // dynamically allocate the character array.
    // take input form user
